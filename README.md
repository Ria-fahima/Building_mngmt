# Building_Management_App
## Problem Identification
Nowadays, in many buildings the apartments are being sold to the customer.The residents need to know all information related to the building. There can be some annoucements, meetings which need to be known to the residents. 
<br>
There can be a situation where the residents can leave the apartment. So, this records must be recorded somewhere.
<br>
All the necessary information of a resident need to be updated by the building manager.
Again, the residents can have some trouble in the building. As here residents live in the apartments they can be either tenant or owner. If they face any issue or something then they need to have the oppurtunity to complain about it.
<br>
The staff recruiment process, their role and accessibility etc need to be stored somewhere for the personal identification.
## Reason to solve the problem
This kind of problems can cause trouble both for residents and staffs in the building. The building manager can send email to individual resident but it is a ineffective process as it kills a lot of time. Again, an app can solve many problem. All the residents just can go to the link to know the recent annoucements/meetings. Also, users(both residents and staffs can complain about anything which can be inappropriate for him/her). This complain list can also be seen through a link.
<br>
The building manager(who is admin of the app) can delete or update any information(e.g: car number, fob number etc) of a resident at any time. As fob can be broken so a new fob maybe replaced the old one. 
<br>
Again, an admin of the app can add resident to the resident list and can delete the full details if the resident leave the apartment.
<br>
The admin can also add, delete or update any information of a staff from the user of the building app.
<br> 
A user can complain in this app which is convenient to the user.
## Database System
For the building management app, i have chosen **PostgreSQL Database System**. As it is a open source DBMS, it has a wide range of possibilities for further developement. Also a large number of communities use this. Modules can be developed by the users and it can be propsed to the community later. It can handle large quantity of data without crashing. In postgreSQL bugs can be identified easity so that it is easy to improve and upgrade. This system is also compatible with different types of data. For data serialization, ORM plays an important role. In PostgreSQL, a user does not need to learn ORM seperately to serialize the data. That's a huge benefit of using PostgreSQL.
